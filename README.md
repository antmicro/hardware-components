# Antmicro Hardware Components

Copyright (c) 2023 [Antmicro](https://www.antmicro.com)

This projects contains a collection of KiCad components used in open hardware designs made by Antmicro.
Each component includes its respective KiCad symbol and footprint.
Additionally there are 3D Blender models provided for most of the components.
The current collection consists mainly of components prepared and maintained in KiCad 6.x.

This project is currently a Work-in-Progress.
The project's primary goal is to aggregate a collection of hardware components in a form suitable both for manual and automated (i.e. scriptable) processing.
A secondary goal of this project is to make it browsable through the Antmicro [Open Hardware Portal](https://openhardware.antmicro.com).

## Project structure

The main directory includes this README and a LICENSE file.
The component-related assets are stored in the following directories: 

* [components](components) - this folder includes subfolders with component definitions. The subfolders are named after a component's manufacturer (MFR) and Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) concatenated with dashes. Each subfolder includes component-related assets.
* [kicad-symbols](kicad-symbols) - this folder contains symbol library files in KiCad format (``*.kicad_sym``). Each file represents a single symbol. 
* [kicad-footprints](kicad-footprints) - this folder contains footprint definitions in KiCad format (``*.kicad_mod``) files.
* [blender-models](blender-models) - this folder contains component Blender models.
* [img](img) - this folder contains general graphical assets for this README.
* [manufacturers](manufacturers) - this folder contains JSON files with allowable manufacturer names that can be associated with components. 
* [tags](tags) - this folder contains JSON files with allowable tags that can be associated with components.

Each of the component-related assets described above includes JSON files which summarize an asset's definitions in a unified, machine-readable form.
Symbols, footprints, and Blender models common to several components are interconnected to respective component definitions via JSON files or symbolic links.
